## The Problem

A few of friends and I started playing poker regularly, but we were using instagram chats to schedule games... ðŸ˜…. 

As the organizer of every game I would message a few dates, times and buy-in amounts and get people to like (vote) the options. After everyone voted, I would count and announce the official date, time and buy-in amount and send reminders to the players throughout the week.


> This process became very tedious as we added more options and clearly, it was very repetitive. We needed a better solution.

The first thing that came to mind was using a third-party polling app, but nearly all of the viable options required a paid subscription.
Our requirements (adding options for a date, time, and buy-in and sending e-mails) were minimal and the service offered did not justify the price. 

And for quite a while I had been intending to learn more about a certain topic.

> What if I could use this as a learning opportunity and develop something using a microservice architecture? 

I had been keen on learning about microservices for quite a while and decided that I could solve this problem by building a distributed system. 

Having limited experience in this space, I began doing what most people would start with: Research!
